Child Theme for WordPress's twentyfourteen theme for sportsalcohol.com

We are happy with twentyfourteen as our site's theme for a number of reasons: It's responsive, it's easy to feature articles at the top, It was created by people whose php/css/etc. skills are better trusted than our webmaster, and the featured images show up at the top of the posts (as opposed to just on certain feed pages that list posts, we wanted that consistency).

The one isue is that it came out shortly before the customizer was introduced into WordPress core. Making tweaks to make the site look different from the stock theme are more invovled. To change the font and default green accent color, I copied and edited .

There are also some slight edits to make some of the plugins we use work: Starbox, Disqus, and Force Ping with Disqus.
